## 001.001 | Overview

There are various methodologies used for preparing your 3D game art for use in-engine.

While the principals covered here are indeed generally applicable, we'll be taking a Maya » Substance » UE4 approach.

<br>

The path we'll take is as follows:

- UV Mapping within Maya: You can use models of your own - or download the example 3D models provided
- Exporting these models and UVs for use within Substance Painter
- Baking high-poly data onto a low-poly model
- Applying colours and textures to your model
- Exporting from Subtance
- Importing to UE4
